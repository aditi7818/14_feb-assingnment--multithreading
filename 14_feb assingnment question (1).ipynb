    "import threading module\n",
    "\n",
    "# step 2: create a thread\n",
    "# to create a new thread, we create an object of thread class. it takes the 'target' and 'args' as the parameters. the target is the function to be executed by the thread whereas\n",

    "#step 4: End the thread Execution\n",
    "# once the threads start, the current program( you can think of it like a main thread) also keeps on executing. In order to stop the execution of the current program until a \n",

    "Question: State advantages and disadvantage of multithreading.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1). Improved performance: Multithreading can help increase the overall perfomance of an application, especially on systems with multiple processors. It allows multiple tasks to run \n",
    "concurrently, utilizing the aviable CPU resorces more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2). Responsiveness: IN a single-threaded enviornment, if a long-running task blocks the main thread, the entire application becomemes unresponsive. Multithreading can prevent this \n",
    "issue by running such tasks in spreade threads, ensuring the application remains responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3). Better resouce utilization: Multithreading allows better utilization of system resources by keeping the CPU busy while for I/O opreations or other task to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "4). Simplified modeling: Some problems can be more naturally modeled using multiple threads. This makes the program easier to design, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5). Parallelism: Multithreading enables parallelism, which can lead to significant perfomance improvements in applications that can be divided into smaller, independent task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1). Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to the program, making it more difficult to design, implement, and debug. Developers need to be aware of synchronization, deadlocks, \n",
    "race conditions, and other concurrency-related issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2).Synchronization overhead: To avoid data corruption and maintain cosistency, developers must synchronize access to shared resources, which can result in additional overhead \n",
    "and reduced perfomance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3). Context switching: Context switching between threads consumes CPU time and resources, which can lead to perfomance degradation if not managed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4). Hard to predict behavior: Due to the concurrent nature of multithreading, the behaviour of the program can be hard to predict and reproduce, especially when it comes to debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "5). Limited by hardware: The perfomance benefits of multithreading are limited by the number of available cores or processors in the system. In some cases, excessive use of threads \n",
    "can lead to perfomance degradation instead of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "IN CONCLUSION, \n",
    "multitherading in python can offer significant advantages in term of perfomance, responsive and resources utilization. however, it also introduces complexity aand potential issues\n",
    "related to synchronization and "

    "Question: Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "    \n",
    "Race Condition: \n",
    "A race condition is a undesirable sitiuation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perfome two or more opreations at the same time, but because of the nature of \n",
    "the device or system, the opreations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.\n",
    "Race conditions are most commonly associated with computer science and programming. they occur when two computer program procrsses, or threads, attempts to access the same resource\n",
    "at the same time and cause problems in the system.\n",
    "Race conditions are considerd a common issue for multithreading applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Of race condition: \n",
    "A simple example of race condition is a light switch. In some homes, there are multiple light switches connected to a common ceilling light. When these types of circuits are used,\n",
    "the switch position becomes irrelevelant. if the light is on, moving either switch from its current position turns the the light off, similarly, if the light is off, then moving \n",
    "either switch from its current position turns the light on.\n",
    "with that in mind, imagine what might happen if two people tried to turn on the light using the different switches at the same time. One instruction might cancel the other or the two\n",
    "actions might trip the circuit breaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occurs.\n",
    "The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of the cause of threading deadlocks include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. A thread that waits on itself(e.g. attempts to acquire the same mutex lock twice.)\n",
    "2. Threads that wait on each other(e.g. A waits on B, B waits on A)\n",
    "3. Thread that fails to release a resoures(e.g. mutex lock, semap"
